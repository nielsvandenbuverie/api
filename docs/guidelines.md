# Teamleader API Design Guidelines

#### REMARK : GUIDELINES ARE RECOMMENDATIONS, NOT LAWS

If for some reason these doesn't fit your case, this can always be discussed.
But it should at least force you to think about the preferred way first.

## General guidelines

### RPC

We are creating an *RPC*-style API, similar to the [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/methods).

These are common actions we use. *Note*:

 - **resource.list** - Get a list objects
 - **resource.info** - Information about a single object
 - **resource.create** - Create a new object (*try to look for better domain language*)
 - **resource.add** - Adding existing objects to a collection (*try to look for better domain language*)
 - **resource.update** - Update an existing object (*try to look for better domain language*)
 - **resource.delete** - Delete an existing object (*try to look for better domain language*)

Usually there will be other actions available for your resource. We need to make sure we make these as explicit and clear as possible.

### Casing

For casing, we agreed the following:

- The objects are camelCased
- The actions are camelCased
- The parameters or object properties are snake_cased

```
/someObject.someAction?some_parameter=value
```

### Abbreviations

We avoid abbreviations, for clarity.

There are exceptions however:

- `id`
- abbreviations common in the **domain**
  - `VAT`
  - (more possible, add when discovered)

## HTTP

### Methods : GET vs. POST

For actions, we require people to `POST` with a `json` body.

For retrieving data, we suggest to `GET` with query parameters.
For sake of simplicity, we also allow you to `POST` with your query as a json body.

```json
POST deals.list
{
  "page": {
    "size": 10,
    "number": 1
  },
  "filter": {
    "company_id": 123
  }
}
```

#### Paging

Paging is 1-based. This means that `page.number: 1` equals the first page.

### Status codes

We try to interpret HTTP Status codes the right way:

- `200 Success` - Used for most [queries](#queries)
- `201 Created` - Used for [commands](#commands) that create an object
- `204 No content` - Used for [commands](#commands) that just need to `ack`

- `400 Bad request` - Used when the request is in the wrong format or doesn't validate
- `401 Unauthorized` - Used when you don't provide a valid Oauth-token
- `403 Forbidden` - Used when you can't access the requested data, because of missing scopes or insufficient rights
- `404 Not found` - Used when requesting something by id, but the id doesn't exist (in your account)
- `500 Intenal Server Error` -  Used when there are uncaught exceptions

### Content-Type & Accept

Use `application/json` for both requests (`Accept`) and responses (`Content-Type`).

### Response format

We wrote our own specification for the format of the response.
You can read it [here](./spec/specification.md) and look at some examples [here](./spec/examples)

## Designing endpoints

### Adding endpoints

- is allowed, because is doesn't break backwards compatibility

### Editing, renaming or deleting endpoints

- as long as we don't have a versioning system, this is **NOT** allowed

### Queries

If you write **read** endpoints, you might consider the following:

- do I need to add filters on the request (might be relevant for `list` endpoints)

### Commands

For commands, we normally return an empty body.
Except when we generated a new `id`, then we return it.

```json
{
  "id": 1
}
```

If you write **command** or **writing** endpoints, you might consider the following:

- if your command can accept multiple values at the same time, allow that

```json
POST contacts.tag
{
  "id": "e8e4510d-87f7-49be-8d88-d13dd03e23b4",
  "tags": ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
}
```

**note** : currently we don't want this for ids, as we don't know how to cope with transactionality yet.

## Designing properties

### Adding properties

- is allowed, because is doesn't break backwards compatibility
- think about :
    - do we also need to add this in similar calls
    - do we need to add this as a filter
    - can this be embedded in other calls

### Editing, renaming or deleting properties

- as long as we don't have a versioning system, this is **NOT** allowed

### Empty properties

If a property has an empty value, we return the property with `null` value.

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": null
}
```

### Ids

Ids that are visibile in the API should always be uuids.
For that case, they need to be represented as a string.

### Date and time

For dates, also timezones might be relevant, so whenever this doesn't add to much confusion, using datetimes **with timezone information** is preferred.
In writes we might allow sending only a date in that case, but time `00:00:00` is assumed, as well as the default timezone of the account.

We always use a `string` for dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format and a `string` for datetime is the `ISO8601` format (`->format('c')` in `php`).

We should call fields that represent dates `...._on`.
We should call fields that represent times `...._at`.

### Money

We have added a datastructure for representing Money.

```json
{
    "amount": 123.03,
    "currency": "EUR"
}
```

We will use it whenever we represent money, both on **queries** and **commands**.

### Referring to other objects/data

When referring to other objects (by `id`) or data of those object, we **need** to represent it as an object (see [spec](./spec/specification.md)).
Even if that is only for the `id`, we might want to add/embed more data later on and don't want to break backwards compatibility then.

The specification also says to include the `_type` for consistency and to be future proof.

```json
{
   "buyer" : {
      "_type": "contact",
      "id" : 1
   }
}

```

As you can see, like this it is also pretty clear when naming the fields different than the type.
It increases flexibility in naming, which helps understandability.

### Meta data

According to the specification you can include `_meta` on almost every level.
So if you want to include data that is not tied to the domain, you have to add it there.

- a _contact's creation date_ is not part of the domain*, so we add it in `_meta`.
- an _invoice's creation date_ is important in the invoicing domain, so it is not in `_meta` data.

* we keep it for audition, synchronization, ... purposes, but in some cases this is arguable
