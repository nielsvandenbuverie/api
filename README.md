# Teamleader API

This repository contains the Teamleader API Definition (in [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/) format). We follow an [API-first]('./docs/api-first.md) development approach, so our implementation follows this definition for 100%.

## Published documentation

We publish a web version of this documentation on [apidocs.teamleader.eu/v2](http://apidocs.teamleader.eu/v2) through Apiary.

## Branches

For now `master` is the current work in progress.
As long as this definition is in `beta`, this will also be the published branch.

We also maintain a `v1` branch, that is not published, for historical purposes.

## How to contribute
